# Ignite Exercise

This is my first app built with React and Styled Components. Fetch github repositories and display them on the screen when the user clicks on the increment or decrement button, handle and display any errors the API might throw. The counter acts as the index for the array that stores the API endpoints. Ex If the counter is 0 `eslint/eslint` will be displayed as Elint is the fist item in the array.

## Install

Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/MattSedmak/Ignite_exercise_2.0.git`

In the project directory, you can run: `npm start`
The app will run in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
